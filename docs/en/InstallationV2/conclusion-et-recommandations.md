# Conclusion and recommendations

It looks like the app setup is complete! There are still avenues to explore, such as sending notifications for different events, customizing formats in Radarr and Sonarr, using lists to automatically add content, etc. It may be worth exploring these options based on your specific needs.

As for recommendations going forward, here is what you can consider:

### Improved SSH security

To improve security, consider configuring SSH to disable root login and change the default port:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

- Change `PermitRootLogin yes` to `PermitRootLogin no`.
- Change the default port by choosing a non-standard port number.

Don't forget to restart the SSH service after your changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

## Additional security

1. **Credentialing protocol**: If you haven't already, consider implementing a secure credentialing protocol, such as Google OAuth2 or Authelia, to strengthen the security of your system.
2. **Cloudflare Optimization**: You can optimize your use of Cloudflare by following the guide available at this address: [Cloudflare Optimization Guide](https://projetssd.github.io/ssdv2_docs/Installation/optimization- cloudflare/). This can help improve the performance and security of your system.
3. **Installation and configuration of UFW**: You can install and configure Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) by following the guide available here: [UFW installation and configuration guide](https://projetssd.github.io /ssdv2_docs/Installation/ufw-Installation-configuration/). This will help you manage firewall rules to enhance security.

**Jacket**:

- Jackett serves as a proxy between your torrent downloading apps and 100+ torrent trackers, allowing you to search a wide range of trackers directly from Sonarr, Radarr, etc. Although Prowlarr offers similar features, Jackett remains a solid alternative or complement, especially if you need to support specific trackers not supported by Prowlarr.

**Jellyfin**:

**Requestr**:

- It is a chatbot tool that allows your friends and family to request movies and TV shows via Discord or Telegram directly to your Sonarr or Radarr server. This is a great way to simplify the request process without needing to grant direct access to your media management tools. Requestrr can automate the process of requesting and adding content to your Plex server, making the experience more interactive and user-friendly.

## Server management and monitoring
